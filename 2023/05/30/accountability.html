<p>Is this what the Rust community wants?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what I mean, I&#8217;m talking about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/13uidp3/accountability_requires_courage/">this Reddit thread</a>, which asks for courage and accountability from the Rust project leadership. That sounds reasonable, who doesn&#8217;t want the leaders to be accountable? The problem is in how they want to achieve it: By asking Rust project members to "name and shame" the people who messed up. But what happens then?</p>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It started with <a href="https://thephd.dev/i-am-no-longer-speaking-at-rustconf-2023">this blog post</a>, where ThePHD explained why they are no longer speaking at RustConf 2023. Some people from the Rust project had reservations about ThePHD&#8217;s work, but it&#8217;s unclear who exactly. Since then, a shitstorm has unfolded as more and more alarming details have come to light. Someone in the Rust leadership even <a href="https://www.jntrnr.com/why-i-left-rust/">resigned in protest</a>, and a well-known Rust educator also <a href="https://gist.github.com/fasterthanlime/42da9378768aebef662dd26dddf04849">ended his involvement</a>. Now, the Rust project leadership has <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/05/29/RustConf.html">apologized</a> and said that the people responsible have resigned from their positions. Of course, people want to know who in the Rust project was responsible.</p>

<h2 id="accountability-whatever-that-means">Accountability, whatever that means</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Rust community has always been perceived as happy and welcoming, and we are proud of that. We have made it possible for anyone, regardless of background, to learn the language, contribute, and propose new features. Changes must follow the RFC process, which is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making">consensus</a>, and communication happens in the open&#8230;&#8203; mostly. Some decisions are time critical or involve personal/confidential information, so we don&#8217;t know everything the Rust leadership does.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does accountability mean? According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability">Wikipedia</a>, it means <em>"A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A&#8217;s (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct" and more.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accountability is important to ensure that people act responsibly. But to whom should Rust&#8217;s leadership be accountable? There are three options:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>They are accountable to each other</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are accountable to another person or group, like a control gremium</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are accountable to the wider Rust community</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last option doesn&#8217;t really make sense though: When an event or decision affects the public, the public should be informed in the interest of transparency. But when someone does something wrong, the public is not in a position to punish the person appropriately, or to fix the problem.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="the-ethics-of-punishment">The ethics of punishment</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every government has a justice system for punishing criminals, even though we don&#8217;t know exactly what “justice” means. People seem to have an innate sense of justice, but it is coupled with our emotions. To justify punishment, it must be <strong>useful</strong>, and of course there are quite a few reasons why punishment is useful:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It prevents the criminal from doing it again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It discourages others from doing anything illegal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The criminal gets to repent and feel less guilty after accepting the punishment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The victim may feel vindicated by getting “revenge”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But before punishing someone, we must first understand why the criminal did it. Most people (including criminals) are not evil psychopaths, and understanding their perspective is important to figure out what to do with them. Therefore, a criminal has the right to a fair trial in any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechtsstaat">Rechtsstaat</a> (legal system).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the Rust project is not a government, but it can still punish someone by banning them or removing them from their leadership position. Of course that person should be given a chance to justify their actions. When someone behaves badly, it&#8217;s usually an accident, often caused by bad communication.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-know-whose-fault-it-was">Why do we need to know whose fault it was?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t, because it wouldn&#8217;t help anyone. I would support it if the people who treated ThePHD harshly apologized <em>on their own terms</em>. But outing them without their permission is not acceptable: It puts them at risk of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shaming">online shaming</a>, which goes against everything that Rust stands for. And even though online shaming can be seen as a punishment for their actions, there are two problems:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Without a trial, we don&#8217;t know what punishment they deserve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A punishment should never violate someone&#8217;s dignity, no matter how serious the crime.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As long as we don&#8217;t have all the information, all we can do is speculate (which doesn&#8217;t mean that we should). Unsurprisingly, the people within the project, who <em>do</em> have all the information, already <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/05/29/RustConf.html">took steps</a> to resolve the conflict and punish those who messed up. The Rust project isn&#8217;t perfect, no organization consisting of humans is. But I do think they are trying their best.</p>
