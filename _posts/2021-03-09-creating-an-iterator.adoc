When I woke up today, I thought, what a great day to start a blog! So here we are. Before we take off, just a short introduction: I'm Ludwig, I'm a CS student from Germany, and I love Rust. Since this blog is about Rust, I hope you do too!

This post is about a core concept in Rust, iterators. If you don't know what iterators are, please read https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch13-02-iterators.html[the chapter about iterators] in the Rust book first.

// END OF EXCERPT

== The collection type

Iterators usually iterate over some sort of collection. Our collection type is a tree:

[source,rust]
----
enum Node<Item> {
    Leaf(Item),
    Children(Vec<Node<Item>>),
}
----

Simple, right? A tree node is either a `Leaf`, in which case it contains an `Item`, or a list of child nodes.

== A `traverse` method

We want to traverse (i.e. iterate over) this kind of tree _depth-first_. This means that when a node has multiple children, we first traverse the first child _and all its descendants_ before moving on to the second child. This is easy to implement with a recursive algorithm:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> Node<It> {
    fn traverse(&self) {
        match self {
            Node::Leaf(_) => {}
            Node::Children(children) => {
                for node in children {
                    node.traverse();
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

If we want to do something with each item, we can pass a closure to the function:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> Node<It> {
    fn traverse(&self, f: impl Fn(&It)) {
        match self {
            Node::Leaf(item) => {
                f(item);
            }
            Node::Children(children) => {
                for node in children {
                    node.traverse(&f);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This allows us to iterate over the items. However, `Node` still doesn't implement the `Iterator` trait, which would be useful because it provides helper methods such as `filter`, `fold` and `collect`.

As we will see shortly, implementing this trait is quite tricky in this case. The reason for this is that the `Iterator` trait provides _external iteration_, whereas our `traverse` method provides _internal iteration_.

[TIP]
.External and internal iteration
--
Internal iteration means that a closure is passed to a function, which calls the closure for every element. This means that the iterator function has full control over the iteration.

External iteration on the other hand means that there's a struct with a method to get the next element. This means that the code _using_ the iterator controls the iteration. It can pause the iteration, do something else, pass the iterator to another function and maybe resume it later. External iteration is therefore very powerful and flexible.
--

== Implementing the `Iterator` trait

To be able to _externally_ iterate over the tree, we need to implement the `Iterator` trait. It looks roughly like this:

[source, rust]
----
trait Iterator {
    type Item;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;
}
----

The iterator trait is usually not implemented for a collection _directly_. Instead, a _new type_ is created that wraps the collection:

[source, rust]
----
struct NodeIter<'a, It>(&'a Node<It>);
----

[TIP]
.Why not implement `Iterator` for the collection?
--
This great question was asked recently on Reddit. One reason is, if the collection implemented the `Iterator` type directly, the collection could be modified during iteration, which is is error-prone and usually undesired. It would also make it impossible to have multiple iterators that iterate over the same collection simultaneously and independently from each other, because the `Iterator::next()` method borrows the iterator mutably.

More importantly, though, iterators usually need additional state to keep track of the position of the next item in the collection. This state needs to be updated in every iteration, which doesn't work if the collection is behind an immutable reference and the state is part of the collection.

If the iterator is a separate type, it can be mutable even though the collection is immutable. You'll see how this works in a moment, just read on!
--

As the immutable reference in the `NodeIter` type indicates, it can only iterate over immutable references of the items. To get an instance of this iterator, we add a `.iter()` method:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> Node<It> {
    fn iter(&self) -> NodeIter<'_, It> {
        NodeIter(self)
    }
}
----

Now we can start with the actual implementation!

[source, rust]
----
impl<'a, It> Iterator for NodeIter<'a, It> {
    type Item = &'a It;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        todo!()
    }
}
----

Now there's a problem: Since `Iterator` provides external iteration, we have to produce one item at a time. This means that we can't use the simple recursive algorithm we used in the `traverse` method. Instead, we have to keep track of the state of the iterator manually:

[source, rust]
----
struct NodeIter<'a, It> {
    children: &'a [Node<It>],
    parent: Option<Box<NodeIter<'a, It>>>,
}
----

The `children` field contains the remaining children of a node, the `parent` field is the iterator of the parent node, if present. It must be wrapped in a `Box` because a struct in Rust can't contain itself without indirection â€“ otherwise, it would be impossible to compute its size on the stack.

So how does this work? When we create the iterator, we put the node into the `children` slice and set `parent` to `None`:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> Node<It> {
    fn iter(&self) -> NodeIter<'_, It> {
        NodeIter {
            children: std::slice::from_ref(self),
            parent: None,
        }
    }
}
----

When the iterator is advanced, we first check if `children` is empty. If that's the case, we try to continue iterating the parent node. If there is no parent node, we return `None`.

If `children` is not empty, we remove the first child and check its variant. If it is a `Node::Leaf`, we return its content; if it is a `Node::Children`, we create a new iterator for the children. The `parent` field is set to `self`, and `self` is replaced with the newly created iterator:

[source, rust]
----
use std::mem;

impl<'a, It> Iterator for NodeIter<'a, It> {
    type Item = &'a It;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        match self.children.get(0) {
            None => match self.parent.take() {
                Some(parent) => {
                    // continue with the parent node
                    *self = *parent;
                    self.next()
                }
                None => None,
            },
            Some(Node::Leaf(item)) => {
                self.children = &self.children[1..];
                Some(item)
            }
            Some(Node::Children(children)) => {
                self.children = &self.children[1..];

                // start iterating the child trees
                *self = NodeIter {
                    children: children.as_slice(),
                    parent: Some(Box::new(mem::take(self))),
                };
                self.next()
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This doesn't work yet, because https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.take.html[`mem::take()`] requires that `NodeIter` implements `Default`. But this can be fixed easily:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> Default for NodeIter<'_, It> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        NodeIter { children: &[], parent: None }
    }
}
----

[TIP]
.The `mem::take()` function
--
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.take.html[`mem::take()`] replaces a mutable reference with its default value and returns the previous value. The previous value is effectively _moved out_ of the reference. We use it here to convert `&mut self` to an owned value, because `parent` must be owned.
--

Now let's see if the iterator works!

== Testing

To check if it works, we can write a unit test:

[source, rust]
----
#[test]
fn test_borrowing_iterator() {
    let tree = Node::Children(vec![
        Node::Leaf(5),
        Node::Leaf(4),
        Node::Children(vec![
            Node::Leaf(3),
            Node::Leaf(2),
            Node::Children(vec![]),
        ]),
        Node::Children(vec![
            Node::Children(vec![
                Node::Children(vec![Node::Leaf(1)]),
                Node::Leaf(0),
            ]),
        ]),
    ]);

    let nums: Vec<i32> = tree.iter().copied().collect();
    assert_eq!(nums, vec![5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]);
}
----

running 1 test
pass:q[[green\]*.*]
test result: pass:q[[green\]*ok*]. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
----

That looks reassuring!

== Adding features

Now that we have a working iterator, let's see how we can improve it. First, let's check if we can implement more iterator methods to make it more efficient!

=== Size hint

Every iterator has a size hint, to help the `collect` methods decide how much memory to allocate when collecting into something like a `Vec`. By default the lower bound of the size hint is 0, so the `collect` method might have to re-allocate a few times. This is still better than setting the size hint too high, because that would waste memory.

Unfortunately, we don't know how many elements a `Node` contains, and calculating the number of elements would be expensive, so we'll skip the `size_hint` method.

=== `FusedIterator`

Sometimes it's useful to ensure that after the iterator produces `None` for the first time, it will only produce `None` values. Iterators with this property are called _fused iterators_, and any iterator can be converted to a fused iterator with the `.fused()` method.

However, if we implement the `FusedIterator` trait for our iterator, calling the `.fused()` method is more efficient, because it has a specialized implementation for types that implement this trait. So let's add it:

[source, rust]
----
use std::iter::FusedIterator;

impl<It> FusedIterator for NodeIter<'_, It> {}
----

That's it!

=== `IntoIterator`

This trait doesn't make the iterator more efficient, just more ergonomic. Implementing `IntoIterator` for `&Node<T>` makes it possible to use a node in a `for` loop without having to write `.iter()` explicitly:

[source, rust]
----
impl<'a, It> IntoIterator for &'a Node<It> {
    type Item = &'a It;

    type IntoIter = NodeIter<'a, It>;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter {
        self.iter()
    }
}
----

Let's try it out:

[source, rust]
----
#[test]
fn test_borrowing_for_loop() {
    let tree = Node::Leaf(42);

    for &node in &tree {
        let _: i32 = node;
    }
}
----

And... it compiles! ðŸŽ‰

=== An owned iterator

We can also implement an iterator that consumes the tree and produces the items as owned values. To implement this iterator, we can copy-paste the borrowed iterator and make a few adjustments:

[source, rust, subs="macros+,quotes+"]
----
struct NodeIntoIter<It> {
    // we use a VecDeque because it allows
    // removing elements from the front efficiently pass:n[footnote:[I was told that you can use a `std::vec::IntoIter` instead of a `VecDeque`, which is more efficient, and also more idiomatic. In the same way, a `std::slice::Iter` can be used for the reference iterator.\]]
    children: VecDeque<Node<It>>,
    parent: Option<Box<NodeIntoIter<It>>>,
}

impl<It> Default for NodeIntoIter<It> {
    fn default() -> Self {
        NodeIntoIter {
            children: Default::default(),
            parent: None,
        }
    }
}

impl<It> Iterator for NodeIntoIter<It> {
    type Item = It;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        match self.children.pop_front() {
            None => match self.parent.take() {
                Some(parent) => {
                    // continue with the parent node
                    *self = *parent;
                    self.next()
                }
                None => None,
            },
            Some(Node::Leaf(item)) => Some(item),
            Some(Node::Children(children)) => {
                // start iterating the child trees
                *self = NodeIntoIter {
                    children: children.into(),
                    parent: Some(Box::new(mem::take(self))),
                };
                self.next()
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Now let's implement `IntoIterator` for `Node`, so we can use it:

[source, rust]
----
impl<It> IntoIterator for Node<It> {
    type Item = It;

    type IntoIter = NodeIntoIter<It>;

    fn into_iter(self) -> Self::IntoIter {
        let mut children = VecDeque::with_capacity(1);
        children.push_back(self);

        NodeIntoIter {
            children,
            parent: None,
        }
    }
}
----

Don't forget to test it:

[source, sh, subs="+quotes,macros+"]
----
> cargo test -q

running 4 tests
pass:q[[green\]*....*]
test result: pass:q[[green\]*ok*]. 4 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s
----

=== A mutable iterator

Collections usually also have an iterator for mutating the items. They can be particularly tricky to implement safely, because you have to ensure that no part of the iterator is ever borrowed mutably multiple times.

But because this blog post is already way too long, I leave this part as an exercise to the reader. ðŸ˜›

[TIP]
.How to borrow multiple things from a slice mutably?
--
Getting multiple mutable references into a slice isn't easy.
One way is to create a mutable iterator with `.iter_mut()`. Also there's a number of methods to help you out:

[.compact-list]
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_at_mut[`split_at_mut`]
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_first_mut[`split_first_mut`]
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_last_mut[`split_last_mut`]
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_mut[`split_mut`]
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_inclusive_mut[`split_inclusive_mut`]

If you got stuck implementing this yourself, you may take a peek at https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=936a02346b3a6703d67bf1de9f8d4cd8[this playground].

=== What about `DoubleEndedIterator`?

`DoubleEndedIterator` is a trait implemented by iterators that can consume items from both ends. However, we won't implement this trait for our iterators, because it would make them much more complicated. And who needs that trait anyway? ðŸ˜‰

== Fin

You should now be able to implement iterators for tree-like data structures.

All code is available in this https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2018&gist=936a02346b3a6703d67bf1de9f8d4cd8[playground]. Discussion on https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/m0wzw7/creating_an_iterator_in_rust/[Reddit].
